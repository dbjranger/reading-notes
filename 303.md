React Docs - lists and keys
What does .map() return? a new array with same number of elements 
If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React? Curly Braces
Each list item needs a unique KEY.
What is the purpose of a key? A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements
- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity
- The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys

The Spread Operator
What is the spread operator? When ...arr is used in the function call, it ‘expands’ an iterable object arr into the list of arguments
List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
- Copying an array
- Concatenating or combining arrays
- Using Math functions
- Using an array as arguments
- Adding an item to a list
- Adding to state in React
- Combining objects
- Converting NodeList to an array

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
-const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂

Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

-const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
- const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
console.log(...ourArray) // 🤪 🐻 🎌 🙂 🤗 🤩

How to Pass Functions Between Components
In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
In your own words, what does the increment function do? The Increment( ) function determines the next node at the same level. You can also increase the level of a node by one at a specified level
How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
1. Create a child component and put the below code inside that component.
2. Now we will import the child component to our parent component.
3. Then inside your parent function create another function to run our desire event and pass the child component to return.
import React from "react";
import "./styles.css";
import Child from './Child'
export default function Parent() {
function clickAlert(){
    alert("I am working")
}
  return (
    <div className="App">
     <Child data="Click here" onChildClick={clickAlert} />
    </div>
  );
}
How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
-Create a boolean variable in the state in the parent class. Update this when you want to call a function. Create a prop variable and assign the boolean variable. From the child component access that variable using props and execute the method you want by having an if condition.
