NOTES:


  - HTML pages are text documents.
  - HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information the surround special meaning.
  - Tags are often referred to as elements.
  - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
  - Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
  - Attributes require a name and a value.

  - DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
  - You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
  - The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
  - The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
  - <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
  - The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
  - Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

  - The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
  - Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
