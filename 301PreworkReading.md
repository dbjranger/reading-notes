Objects and Inheritance
JavaScript objects use prototype-based inheritance. 

When methods or properties are attached to object’s prototype they become available for use on that object and its descendants, but not directly attached to them.

When you use class and extends keywords internally JavaScript will still use prototype-based inheritance. While classes are easier to use, it’s still very important to understand how prototype-based inheritance works.
