Reading
Here are the chapters to read before class:

From the Duckett JS book:

JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”

- Understanding execution contexts (which have two
stages) and stacks, is very important in helping to find the error in your code.
- Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it better by using the try, catch, finally statements.
- Use Stack Overflow 
- Try different browsers
- Add numbers to see how far the code gets before the error
- Strip the code back like peeling back layers to uncover the origin of the bug
- Validation tools
- Explaining the bug to others helps to visualize the problem
