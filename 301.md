In this section I learned the following:

The difference between function components and components
Using Babel for Visual Studio to detect React syntax
React Chrome extension:  this allows you to inspect react elements
Always start React component names with a capital letter.
All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input

We created a tic tac toe game and reviewed state and how components are controlled by their parent.
