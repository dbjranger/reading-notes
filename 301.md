Component Based Architecture
What is a component?  A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

What are the charactistics of a component?  A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

What are the advantages of using component based architecture?  Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

What is Props and How to Use it in React

What is props short for? “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

How are props used in React? Using Props in React
I will be explaining how to use Props step by step.
Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
Finally, render the Props Data

What is the flow of props? But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)  Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.

In this section I learned the following:

The difference between function components and components
Using Babel for Visual Studio to detect React syntax
React Chrome extension:  this allows you to inspect react elements
Always start React component names with a capital letter.
All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function:

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input

We created a tic tac toe game and reviewed state and how components are controlled by their parent.
