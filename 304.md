What is a ‘Controlled Component’? a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form.  An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.   Grab the data immediately by changing the state. 

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?  this.state.value


The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator?  Perhaps shorter/more precise code vs. something like an 'if' statement. 



Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
  if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }

  let answer = x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
