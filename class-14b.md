What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

The reading was interesting and the main points that really struck a note with me were:

Teams that converse vs. those that get straight down to business
In my experience everybody has always more or less disliked meetings.  So I feel by setting the standard of getting down to business and running an efficient meeting while leaving time at the end for general conversation or follow-up is ideal

Group Think vs. Teams that freely exchange ideas
Junior developers will never be able to fully spread their wings and grow if their ideas are stunted and they blindly follow the strongest developer.  A lot, if not most, learning comes from failure and understanding why something will not work.  So while the senior dev may have the best idea, it’s ideal to let everybody contribute and perhaps talk through each scenario to understand why something may or may not work.  In addition you can assign rating criteria to all the ideas to better understand the value of one’s approach. 

Metrics for qualitative and qualitative data
If you can measure it, you can manage it is what they say.  Too many times when asked if they’re improving will say “yes”.  That’s great, but how do you know if you’re improving or ‘how much’ are you improving if you can’t establish a baseline and define standard metrics to measure your data.
