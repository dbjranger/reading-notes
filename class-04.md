<h1>Reading</h1>
From the Duckett HTML book:
Chapter 4: Ch.4 “Links” (pp.74-93)
Chapter 15: “Layout” (pp.358-404)
Note: This layout chapter is BIG. Focus your attention on understanding the core concepts presented on pp.358-364, and look at the code samples on the website that accompanies the textbook. You will have another reading assignment on this chapter, so do not try to digest it all now.
From the Duckett JS book:
Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)
Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”

- Links are created using the <a> element.
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

- <div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.
