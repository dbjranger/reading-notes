Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
Render

What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
Mounting

Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
Constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount


What does componentDidMount do? 
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
setState() can be called here, but it should be used sparingly, because it will cause a rerender, which can lead to perfomance issues.
Here we use componentDidMount() to connect to the YouTube API and get videos when the components is rendered.


What types of things can you pass in the props?
Arguments to a function.  Intial count inside of the props.  Initializing a component so it will render. 


What is the big difference between props and state?
State is 'inside' a compoenent.  Props you 'pass into the component'.  The state deals within the component.  State is handled and updatd inside the component. 


When do we re-render our application?
If you change the state of a component you want the application to re-render


What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
Inside of a form to store the values that the user enters. 
A button could be another example
