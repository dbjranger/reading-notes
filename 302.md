The readng was interesting in showing how to convert a Function to a React Class and adding local state and methods to a Class.

It was also informative to learn how React Handling Events are nameds using camelCase vs. lowercase and that with JSX you can pass a function as the event handler vs. a string. 

I want to get into React Bootstrap more for rapid prototypign.
