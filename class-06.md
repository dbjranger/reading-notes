Understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming

- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value. 
- An object is a series of variables and functions that represent something from the world around you. 
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.  

- The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
- You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. 
- Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st. 
- From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques. 
- An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 
- Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
