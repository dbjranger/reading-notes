What does REST stand for? 
Representational State Transfer (REST)
REST APIs are designed around a ____.
REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.
which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

What are the most common HTTP verbs?
The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
What should the URIs be based on?
Level 0: Define one URI, and all operations are POST requests to this URI.
Level 1: Create separate URIs for individual resources.
Level 2: Use HTTP methods to define operations on resources.
Level 3: Use hypermedia (HATEOAS, described below).

Give an example of a good URI.
When possible, resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).
https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good
https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
Another factor is that all web requests impose a load on the web server. The more requests, the bigger the load. Therefore, try to avoid "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources. Such an API may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all of the data that it requires. Instead, you might want to denormalize the data and combine related information into bigger resources that can be retrieved with a single request. However, you need to balance this approach against the overhead of fetching data that the client doesn't need. Retrieving large objects can increase the latency of a request and incur additional bandwidth costs. For more information about these performance antipatterns, see Chatty I/O and Extraneous Fetching.What status code does a successful GET request return?
What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
GET methods
A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK). If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

What status code does a successful POST request return?
If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response. The response body contains a representation of the resource.
What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process has been successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).
