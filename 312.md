SQL	vs. NoSQL
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. 

NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load. 
 	 
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?  structure data
Give a real world example. data in salesforce where there are a lot of relationships and transactions
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? unstructured data
Give a real world example.  not a lot of transactions like Craigslist.
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? For the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.
Which type of database is best for scalability? For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
